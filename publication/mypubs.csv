Parliamentary Functioning in Italy and Denmark during the Pandemic","Representaiton","","","0.1080/00344893.2021.1973546","","The COVID-19 pandemic challenged parliamentary decisionmaking, which is normally based on time-consuming deliberation and scrutiny. We ask how national parliaments met this challenge during the ﬁrst wave in the spring 2020, and we argue that institutional powers of the executive designed to handle crises just like a pandemic, paradoxically, increase challenges to democratic decision-making because the parliament misses opportunities to negotiate institutional adjustments accommodating pressure of government takeover. We evaluate this argument based on a comparative study of parliamentary activity in Italy and Denmark during the ﬁrst wave of COVID-19 and ﬁnd that both parliaments came under pressure with regard to law-making and control, but only the Danish parliament was able to install eﬀective mechanisms to regain lost powers. It is too early to conclude on parliamentary consequences of COVID19, but our study suggests that parliamentary reforms in response to the COVID-19 democratic challenges will mainly manifest in political systems without strong institutions to handle states of emergency.","2021","2021-09-06 15:36:28","2023-03-12 13:53:48","","401-418","","4","57","","","","","","","","","","en","All rights reserved","","","","Zotero","","","","/Users/eborghetto/Documents/Zotero/storage/Pedersen_Borghetto_2021_Fighting COVID-19 on Democratic Terms.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While the rules that govern the core agenda-setting tool of parliamentary questions vary from country to country affecting how many and who can ask questions, more universal rules concerning parliamentary seats, the effect of opposition parties, and the role niche parties play have common effects across all parliaments. To test these common effects while accounting for institutional differences, we consider how they drive the scope (the range of issues) of parliamentary questions asked by political parties across six Western European countries for an extended period of time. Our results show that while institutional differences driving the number of questions affects scope as does the length of a cabinet, notable effects for the number of parliamentary seats, opposition parties, and green parties on scope exist cross-nationally. Our work suggests that when it comes to parliamentary attention, both institutions and common differences in political party styles are important drivers.","2021","2021-07-17 17:08:35","2021-09-07 12:53:02","","244-256","","","","","","","","","","","Routledge","","","All rights reserved","","","","","","Num Pages: 13","","/Users/eborghetto/Documents/To_read/Bevan et al. - 2021 - The politics of parliamentary agenda-setting styles 2.pdf","","","","Howlett, Michael; Tosun, Jale","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This article relies on content analysis of election manifestos to examine the use of populist claims by the main Portuguese parties before and after the crisis (1995–2015). Our findings reveal that populist rhetoric has been used mainly by left-wing radical parties as a wedge to disrupt a decade-old status quo. Moreover, we did not find a significant increase in the frequency of populist rhetorical elements after the crisis, either in mainstream or challenger parties. Overall, in the Portuguese case, ideology is the most important factor that explains the adoption of a populist discourse.","2018-10-02","2019-02-11 11:13:29","2020-07-05 12:52:59","2019-02-11 11:13:29","405-427","","4","23","","","Populism, Blame Shifting and the Crisis","","","","","","","","All rights reserved","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","","","/Users/eborghetto/Documents/Zotero/storage/IY65RK3A/Lisi_Borghetto_2018_Populism, Blame Shifting and the Crisis.pdf","","populism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Parties select which issue to address by weighing up two commitments simultaneously: fulfilling the party mandate received by their voters at election time and responding to the current priorities of voters. This article assesses the extent to which the recent sovereign debt crisis impacted the way parties balance these two imperatives of democratic representation. Through the issue coding of around 10,000 parliamentary oral questions tabled in Italy, Portugal and Spain between 2003 and 2014, the analysis shows that the worsening of economic conditions intensified the impact of citizens’ priorities. However, there is no clear evidence of a decline in the importance of the party mandate for either the majority or opposition parties. These findings offer insights on the topic of party political representation in Southern Europe and whether it was affected by the Eurozone crisis.","2018-01-01","2018-01-17 18:32:21","2018-01-17 18:32:21","2018-01-17 18:32:21","65-77","","1","24","","Party Politics","From agenda setters to agenda takers?","","","","","","","en","All rights reserved","","","","SAGE Journals","","","","/Users/eborghetto/Documents/Zotero/storage/N67QARLN/Borghetto_Russo_2018_From agenda setters to agenda takers.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The article maps these transformations in Italian democracy by tracing the formal transfer of national powers to subnational and EU levels. In addition, it portrays the driving forces behind this competence shift and discusses other outcomes of the process besides the changes in the Italian Constitution and EU Treaties. It concludes that central institutions have only adapted partially and incrementally to this formal transfer of powers.","2015","2015-02-06 15:01:29","2015-03-29 17:04:57","2015-02-06 15:01:29","58-75","","1","7","","","","","","","","","","","All rights reserved","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","","","/Users/eborghetto/Documents/Zotero/storage/77ZMJBN8/Borghetto_2015_Challenging Italian centralism through the vertical shift of competences to the.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet, we still know little about how cabinets micro-manage the content of their multifaceted agenda during their term in office. Drawing on the party and agenda-setting literature, this article addresses this gap by focusing on three main determinants of cabinet priorities: issue priorities in the electoral platforms of majority and opposition parties, and new and unforeseen problems as conveyed by the media. Our analysis reveals that (1) majority platforms have a stronger impact on the cabinet agenda than those of opposition parties, but this effect decreases as the legislative term progresses; (2) cabinet agendas do take into consideration opposition electoral priorities but only when the latter are expressed by mainstream competitors or when the media focus on them and (3) an externally imposed adjustment programme can also create the conditions for strengthening the congruence between electoral and cabinet agendas.","2020","2019-02-15 15:24:39","2020-04-29 13:52:17","2019-06-04 11:57:32","37-53","","1","68","","","Party Manifestos, Opposition and Media as Determinants of the Cabinet Agenda","","","","","","","en","All rights reserved","","","Sage UK: London, England","journals.sagepub.com","","","","/Users/eborghetto/Documents/Zotero/storage/J244TD7U/Borghetto_Belchior_2020_Party Manifestos, Opposition and Media as Determinants of the Cabinet Agenda.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With parliamentary ranks filled mostly with inexperienced politicians and a strong identification with the role of outsiders challenging the mainstream political consensus, the expectation is that their opposition style should differ substantially from that of other parties. This article explores this question by comparing the policy content of oral parliamentary questions submitted by the M5S with that of other Italian opposition parties during the 17th legislature (2013-2018). It analyses to what extent the M5S’s issue profile 1) overlaps more with parties of either the left or the right side of the political spectrum, 2) is more likely to deal with matters emphasised in its electoral platform, and 3) is more likely to address issues not attended to by other parties.

It has given traditionally weak executives the opportunity to adopt significant reforms while bypassing the notorious fetters of the ordinary legislative process. While the literature has to date focused on the motivations to delegate, there is still a research gap on what the executive does with the delegated authority. Based on a newly collected data set covering all delegation provisions adopted from 1987 to 2013, this article analyses why, in a remarkable number of cases, the cabinet did not use the delegations. Results show that the existence of an agreement on the policy in question (as captured by the precision of delegating criteria), as well as the complexity and timing of the delegation have a significant impact on the likelihood a delegation is used.","2018-04-03","2018-07-02 09:02:35","2020-07-02 08:55:40","2018-07-02 09:02:35","179-196","","2","24","","","Delegated decree authority in a parliamentary system","","","","","","","","All rights reserved","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","","","/Users/eborghetto/Documents/Zotero/storage/TYJY3TKR/Borghetto_2018_Delegated decree authority in a parliamentary system.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

They analyse a broad range of institutional and policy venues, including public opinion, political parties, the executive, the Parliament, and the Constitutional Court. While single articles address different research questions and focus on different institutions, they all share a focus on the dynamics of issue attention over time.

The analysis relies on data sets of the Italian Agendas Project recording the issue content of party manifestos and laws and covering the period 1983–2012. The results of time series cross-sectional models lend support to the presence of a mandate effect in Italy, a mechanism which was strengthened after the introduction of alternation in government. Opposition priorities may have an impact on the legislative agenda, but mostly when considering the legislation initiated in Parliament. Our findings have important implications for the understanding of the impact of government alternation, an institutional feature underlying – with varying intensity – most democracies, on the functioning of democratic representation.","2018-11","2019-01-10 17:15:29","2020-07-02 08:55:16","2019-01-10 17:15:29","275-288","","3","48","","","Changing the transmission belt","","","","","","","en","All rights reserved","","","","Cambridge Core","","","","/Users/eborghetto/Documents/Zotero/storage/VMPUQDIH/Carammia et al_2018_Changing the transmission belt.pdf; /Users/eborghetto/Documents/Zotero/storage/SXX33F9A/Carammia et al_2018_Changing the transmission belt.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this article, we redress this bias by investigating the formal role of subnational authorities in the implementation of EU regulatory policies, specifically in the transposition of directives. Subnational authorities play a secondary, but increasingly important, role in the application of these measures. Their impact is greater on environmental and social policies, as it is also on public contract legislation. More decentralized states display higher levels of subnational involvement but, in these states, regional participation in national policy-making and a high number of regional authorities decrease the likelihood of finding subnational measures of transposition. There is also more subnational involvement in states with territories that have both an elected government as well as special arrangements regulating their relations with the EU. Finally, subnational involvement tends to prolong the process of transposition.","2010-09-01","2009-03-30 21:30:48","2020-07-02 08:50:53","2019-07-23 20:00:08","759-780","","6","17","","","","","","","","","","","All rights reserved","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","","","/Users/eborghetto/Documents/Zotero/storage/CE35QMTG/Borghetto_Franchino_2010_The Role of Subnational Authorities in the Implementation of EU Directives.pdf; /Users/eborghetto/Documents/Zotero/storage/XMG596WB/Borghetto_Franchino_2010_The role of subnational authorities in the implementation of EU directives.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It argues that rising inequality makes agenda setting especially vulnerable to the influence of economic elites, and that elites use their influence to keep redistributive policies from receiving governmental attention. Empirical tests use data on public laws and bills introduced in the legislatures of five European countries between 1981 and 2012, and the United States between 1948 and 2015. As inequality becomes more acute, we observe a migration in legislative attention away from issues dealing with the social safety-net. These effects are more pronounced earlier in the policy process, which is consistent with the idea that elites can act as gatekeepers of legitimate policy ideas. These findings suggest that economic stratification shapes the policymaking debate in ways that make redistribution less likely.","2021-04-03","2020-02-23 18:44:50","2021-03-22 10:47:13","2021-03-22 10:46:53","532-550","","4","28","","","Legislative agendas during periods of inequality","","","","","","","","All rights reserved","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","Publisher: Routledge _eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/13501763.2020.1734060","","/Users/eborghetto/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/Comparative/cofog_eu/literature/Epp_Borghetto_2021_Legislative agendas during periods of inequality.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

If, in some legislative assemblies, the difficult balance between the right to health and the functioning of parliamentary institutions has been pursued through the implementation of measures that contemplate the use of remote participation and voting, the choices made by the Italian chambers have been more conservative, never coming to favor such solutions, at least in the plenary. This paper contributes to the debate on the digitization of parliamentary assemblies by analyzing the political reasons behind the decision to maintain the status quo in Italy, a country where the containment measures to limit the spread of Covid-19 were among the strictest in the world.","2023","2023-07-26 10:16:32","2023-08-12 07:07:07","","5-19","","1","9","","","","","","","","","","en","All rights reserved","","","","Zotero","","","","/Users/eborghetto/Documents/Zotero/storage/Borghetto_2023_Virtual Parliament in Italy.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This windfall represents both a historic opportunity for economic revitalization and an unprecedented external constraint for Italy. By linking two established research agendas, the coalition life cycle and the Europeanisation of domestic politics, this study examines the extent to which external constraints arising from EU membership may have affected coalition governance. Using a longitudinal design spanning almost three decades (1996-2023), the study finds that the implementation of the recovery plan is associated both with new trends and the accentuation of existing ones, including the strengthening of the prime minister’s role.","2024","2024-11-24 10:25:37","2024-11-24 10:45:04","2024-11-24 10:25:37","1-21","","0","0","","","Coalition politics under exceptional exogenous constraints","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","Publisher: Routledge _eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/13608746.2024.2413852","","/Users/eborghetto/Documents/To_read/Borghetto et al. - 2024 - Coalition politics under exceptional exogenous constraints the Meloni government during the EU-fina.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Through a comparative analysis of NRRPs drafting in Germany, France, Italy and Spain, and an in-depth longitudinal study of Italy, we argue that the partisan profile of national executives, to a significant extent, accounts for which reforms were included in the respective national plans, while the domestic usage of Europe by national executives explains how they went about embedding those reforms in the NRRPs. In terms of research design, we first match the reform priorities outlined in the political manifestos of the governing parties and those included in the NRRPs. Second, through a systematic analysis of press coverage, we sketch out how national executives leveraged (or not) Europe domestically during the drafting of their respective plans. Our findings contribute to shed light on the interplay between domestic political dynamics and EU-level requirements, demonstrating how governments navigated the tension between fulfilling their electoral mandates, building domestic support for their reform agendas and adhering to EU guidelines and constraints.","2025","2025-03-28 07:39:02","2025-03-28 07:40:15","2025-03-28 07:39:02","","","n/a","n/a","","","Reform Agendas in National Recovery and Resilience Plans","","","","","","","en","All rights reserved","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/jcms.13738","","/Users/eborghetto/Documents/To_read/Borghetto et al. - 2025 - Reform Agendas in National Recovery and Resilience Plans Partisan Politics and Domestic Usages of E.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using data on the evaluations of the implementation of the 2019–2020 country-specific recommendations (CSRs) before (2021) and after (2022–2024) the official start of the programme, we assess to what extent the RRF conditionality impacts the effectiveness of the European Semester. The findings of our statistical analysis indicate that the amount of RRF funding received, relative to GDP, is significant for compliance. Other factors play a role: a higher problem load, measured by the average yearly CSRs from 2011 to 2019, and sector-specific challenges, like those in energy, negatively impacted policy implementation. Conversely, countries with an initially lower compliance with the Commission’s recommendations received more favourable evaluations. Similarly, reforms concerning financial and fiscal governance performed better than average. This paper contributes to the literature on the implementation of the RRF and its impact on the reshaping of EU economic governance by demonstrating that it has improved compliance with CSRs, underpinning domestic reform efforts.","2025","2025-05-13 09:00:46","2025-05-13 09:01:55","2025-05-13 09:00:46","1-25","","0","0","","","Stronger conditionality for stronger compliance?","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","Publisher: Routledge _eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/13501763.2025.2502088","","/Users/eborghetto/Documents/Zotero/storage/Guardiancich et al. - Stronger conditionality for stronger compliance Analysing the NGEU’s effect on the implementation o.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
