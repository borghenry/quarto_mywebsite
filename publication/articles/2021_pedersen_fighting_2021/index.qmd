abstract: |
  The COVID-19 pandemic challenged parliamentary decisionmaking, which is normally based on time-consuming deliberation and scrutiny. We ask how national parliaments met this challenge during the ﬁrst wave in the spring 2020, and we argue that institutional powers of the executive designed to handle crises just like a pandemic, paradoxically, increase challenges to democratic decision-making because the parliament misses opportunities to negotiate institutional adjustments accommodating pressure of government takeover. We evaluate this argument based on a comparative study of parliamentary activity in Italy and Denmark during the ﬁrst wave of COVID-19 and ﬁnd that both parliaments came under pressure with regard to law-making and control, but only the Danish parliament was able to install eﬀective mechanisms to regain lost powers. It is too early to conclude on parliamentary consequences of COVID19, but our study suggests that parliamentary reforms in response to the COVID-19 democratic challenges will mainly manifest in political systems without strong institutions to handle states of emergency.
