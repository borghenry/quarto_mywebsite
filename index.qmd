I am an Associate Professor in the [Department of Political and Social Sciences](https://www.dsps.unifi.it/) (DSPS), [University of Florence](https://www.unifi.it). I [teach](https://unifi.coursecatalogue.cineca.it/docente-id/689ec947f48d507bfb514310/2025) an undergraduate-level course in Comparative Politics as well as a Masterâ€™s-level course in European politics.

My research focuses on comparative political institutions, with particular attention to parliamentary agenda-setting, coalition governance, crisis politics, and the interplay between national and European decision-making.

I am a co-founder and co-PI of both the [Italian Policy Agendas Project](#0) and the [Portuguese Policy Agendas Project](#0). I also coordinate the [Jean Monnet Module REPLAN-EU](#0) (*Implementing Resilience and Recovery Plans in Italy and Beyond*) and lead the Florence-based research unit of the [REPLAN-EU PRIN](#0) project.

In addition, I serve on the Board of Directors and act as Scientific Coordinator of the *Service Center for Country and Institutional Data* at the DSPS. The center is part of the European research infrastructure project [MEDEM - Monitoring Electoral Democracy](#0).
