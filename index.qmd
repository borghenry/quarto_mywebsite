I am an Associate Professor in the [Department of Political and Social Sciences](https://www.dsps.unifi.it/) and at the [School of Political Science "Cesare Alfieri"](https://www.sc-politiche.unifi.it/index.php) at the University of Florence.

I [teach](https://unifi.coursecatalogue.cineca.it/docente-id/689ec947f48d507bfb514310/2025) an introductory undergraduate-level course in Political Science as well as a Masterâ€™s-level course in European politics.

My research focuses on comparative political institutions, with particular attention to parliamentary agenda-setting, coalition governance, crisis politics, and the interplay between national and European decision-making. I investigate how political actors shape policy priorities, allocate attention across issues, and adapt institutional processes in response to challenges such as populism and crises.

I am a co-founder and principal investigator of both the [Italian Policy Agendas Project](https://www.comparativeagendas.net/project/italy) and the [Portuguese Policy Agendas Project](https://www.comparativeagendas.net/project/portugal). I also coordinate the [Jean Monnet Module REPLAN-EU](https://www.dsps.unifi.it/p577.html) (*Implementing Resilience and Recovery Plans in Italy and Beyond*) and lead the Florence-based research unit of the [REPLAN-EU PRIN](https://www.replaneuresearch.eu/home-page) project.

In addition, I serve on the Board of Directors and act as Scientific Coordinator of the *Service Center for Country and Institutional Data* at the Department of Political and Social Sciences. The center is part of the European research infrastructure project [MEDEM - Monitoring Electoral Democracy](https://www.medem.eu/).
