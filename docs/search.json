Distinguished speakers and experts from various fields examined these crises from different perspectives and deliberated on how democracies should effectively respond to these developments.\nI participated as an expert in the panel discussion titled “How rich private actors disproportionately influence democratic decision making and what can be done about it.”\n\n\n\nFormer President Hollande delivering his keynote speech"

Democracy and the rule of law, climate change and environmental policies, foreign policy and the international situation, as well as energy and migration policies, were among the topics addressed by questions posed by students from the Schools of Law and Political Science at the University of Florence and researchers from Ponte Europa to three Members of the European Parliament.\nI collaborated to organize the event together with colleagues of the Schools of Political Science and Law of the University of Florence, EUROPE DIRECT Florence and Siena centers, the University of Siena, the European Documentation Centers of the University of Florence and the European University Institute, and Ponte Europa, with the support of the European Parliament Office in Italy and the Representation of the European Commission in Italy. Francesca Peppucci (Forza Italia – EPP), Beatrice Covassi (Democratic Party – S&D), and Nicola Danti (Italia Viva – Renew Europe) responded to the organizers’ invitation and made themselves available to answer the multitude of questions within a limited time frame. This event, organized in anticipation of the upcoming electoral appointment in June, where European citizens will head to the polls to renew their representatives in Parliament, underscores the significance of discussing European elections, promoting awareness of their context and importance, and encouraging citizen participation, particularly among younger individuals, through initiatives like the one held last Friday and others scheduled leading up to June 9. For those who missed the event, the live stream is available on YouTube."

In most cases, this translated into a process of modernization of their ICT capacity. Starting from an analysis of the reaction to the first waves of the health emergency of 2020-2021 - assumed as a paradigmatic case study to analyse the dynamics of technological reorganization of parliamentary procedures - this research project aims to investigate the implications, the potential and, where appropriate, the risks of the introduction of ICT solution in the context of parliamentary work.\nFor more information go the official website: http://www.legitechresearch.it/"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Here is the link to the article in English (only a few excerpts).\nHere is the full transcript (in Italian).\n\n“Spenderemo al meglio i 68,9 miliardi a fondo perduto e i 122,6 miliardi concessi a prestito all’Italia dal Next Generation EU. Senza ritardi e senza sprechi, e concordando con la Commissione europea gli aggiustamenti necessari per ottimizzare la spesa, alla luce soprattutto del rincaro dei prezzi delle materie prime e della crisi energetica”.\n\nCome commenta queste parole pronunciate da Giorgia Meloni oggi alla Camera? In particolare dopo le polemiche relative alla revisione del PNRR susseguitesi durante la campagna elettorale.\nDal mio punto di vista, sono parole di rassicurazione dirette ai mercati, ai partner europei e agli italiani: l’implementazione del PNRR non è a rischio anche senza Draghi alla cabina di regia. Le leggo come un tentativo, più volte ripetuto nel corso della campagna elettorale, di raccogliere la pesante eredità del precedente presidente del Consiglio. Un politico/tecnico non solo apprezzato a livello internazionale ma che ha goduto di una notevole popolarità presso l’opinione pubblica italiana, anche tra gli elettori di Fratelli d’Italia. Queste parole sono anche una prova di equilibrismo dialettico attraverso cui Giorgia Meloni vuole presentarsi come la voce pragmatica (vedi altre parti del suo discorso) in un dibattito europeo prigioniero delle ideologie, irrigidito e chiuso alla critica. Parlo di equilibrismo perché Meloni, nel suo nuovo ruolo di premier e non di leader di un partito di opposizione, dovrà dimostrare sul campo le sue doti di pragmatismo senza perdere il contatto con una parte del suo elettorato che risponde maggiormente a slogan ideologici. Interpreto il riferimento ad “aggiustamenti necessari” proprio come una strizzata d’occhio a quell’elettorato. Difficile commentare queste parole senza sapere su quali capitoli incideranno questi aggiustamenti. Senza entrare nelle complessità legali, cambiare gli impegni del PNRR in corso d’opera è difficile, richiede passaggi relativamente lunghi (dipende dall’entità degli aggiustamenti richiesti) e l’approvazione di diversi attori, il ché cozza con un’idea di piano di ripresa in risposta a un’emergenza fondato su un preciso cronoprogramma. Altra questione è utilizzare parte degli investimenti e delle riforme all’interno della cornice di NextGenerationEU per raggiungere gli obiettivi del piano REPowerEU. Si tratta di una serie di azioni concertate a livello europeo per il risparmio energetico, la diversificazione delle fonti di approvvigionamento e l’accelerazione della transizione verso un’energia pulita. Soltanto per conseguire questi obiettivi specifici, la stessa Commissione ha recentemente previsto una rimodulazione dei Piani di Ripresa nazionali.\n\n“La strada per ridurre il debito non è la cieca austerità imposta negli anni passati e non sono neppure gli avventurismi finanziari più o meno creativi. La strada maestra è la crescita economica, duratura e strutturale. E per conseguirla siamo naturalmente aperti a favorire gli investimenti esteri: se da un lato contrasteremo logiche predatorie che mettano a rischio le produzioni strategiche nazionali, dall’altro saremo aperti ad accogliere quelle imprese straniere che sceglieranno di investire in Italia, portando sviluppo, occupazione e know-how in una logica di benefici reciproci. In questo contesto si inserisce il Piano Nazionale di Ripresa e Resilienza. Fondi raccolti con l’emissione di debito comune europeo per fronteggiare crisi di portata globale. Una proposta avanzata a suo tempo dal governo di centrodestra con l’allora ministro dell’economia Giulio Tremonti, per anni avversata, talvolta derisa, ed infine adottata”.\n\nCome valuta la strategia economica preannunciata dalla neo premier?\nIn riferimento al passo citato, da non economista posso solo ricordare che il PNRR non consiste soltanto in un consistente flusso di risorse verso il nostro paese. Si tratta anche, e non in piccola parte nel caso del nostro paese, di riforme destinate a modernizzare il paese e, in parte, garantire l’uso efficiente dei programmi di investimento contenuti nel PNRR. Se dimostriamo di riuscire a mettere a terra queste riforme, liberamente concordate dai nostri rappresentanti insieme alle istituzioni comunitarie, e di riuscire ad assorbire questa enorme mole di finanziamenti europei, c’è da aspettarsi un guadagno in termini di credibilità e attrattività per l’economia italiana. Più che puntando sulla “sovranità tecnologica” o la “salvaguardia dell’interesse nazionale”, il rilancio della competitività dell’economia italiana passa quindi attraverso una tempestiva e corretta implementazione del PNRR. Un banco di prova per il futuro governo sarà per esempio la legge sulla concorrenza.\nMeloni si è intestata la battaglia del debito comune europeo, riferendosi al governo di centrodestra di cui faceva parte il ministro Tremonti piuttosto che al governo Draghi. Fa bene a dare merito a Tremonti o è un tentativo forzato di portare acqua al suo mulino?\nNon mi stupisce che in molti cerchino di mettere le bandierine sull’accordo che ha portato a NextGenerationEU. Si tratta di un piano che rilancia il processo di integrazione europea dopo un decennio di profonde crisi e cerca di riparare ai danni sociali, economici e, aggiungerei, politici causati dalle politiche di austerità. Inoltre, anche se trovo limitativo valutare il rapporto tra Europa e Italia in termini di semplice dare e avere, l’Italia figura tra i maggiori beneficiari. Senza entrare nella querelle della paternità del piano, che trovo sterile, voglio ricordare solo un fatto. Molti dei lavori accademici che si sono cimentati nella ricostruzione dei negoziati che hanno portato all’accordo (siglato nel Consiglio Europeo del luglio 2020) concordano che i meriti del compromesso vanno attribuiti soprattutto alla leadership franco-tedesca. Partiti da fronti distinti, in pochi mesi dallo scoppio della pandemia i governi dei due paesi hanno intensificato i loro rapporti bilaterali e ricucito le tante divisioni che laceravano i paesi membri in tema di potere fiscale dell’Unione. Per quanto questa narrazione metta in ombra il ruolo di negoziatore dell’Italia, ci spinge a dirigere la nostra attenzione verso questioni più rilevanti e di lungo periodo. Dobbiamo riconoscere, in primo luogo, che la trasformazione di NGEU in uno strumento permanente non può prescindere dall’accordo dei due paesi fondatori. Per il momento, il sostegno tedesco alla proposta è notevolmente più timido di quello transalpino. Secondo, l’Italia ha ancora un ruolo importante da giocare. Il successo del PNRR italiano, per il suo peso economico e simbolico, rappresenta una condizione necessaria per dare una speranza al progetto di un’Unione economica e monetaria in cui il pilastro economico abbia lo stesso peso di quello monetario."

The event was organised by the University of Florence, the researcher-led working group Ponte Europa at EUI, Europe Direct Firenze and the Municipality of Florence. EU Talks serve as a platform for students from the University of Florence to engage in discussions on the future of Europe. These discussions also involve facilitators selected from researchers at UniFI and the EUI. Throughout the event, UniFI students had the opportunity to present and reflect on the outcomes of their deliberations through three roundtable discussions focusing on mobility, equal opportunities, and cultural heritage. At the conclusion of the deliberation process, the groups were encouraged to propose constructive ideas regarding the three topics within the context of Florence. This year marked the first close collaboration with the Municipality of Florence for the project. As a result, this third edition of EU Talks adopted a local dimension, urging the groups to consider the European and local contexts while deliberating on the mentioned themes.\n\nTo watch the video of the event and read the position papers, follow this link"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract: ‘The COVID-19 pandemic challenged parliamentary decision-making, which is normally based on time-consuming deliberation and scrutiny. We ask how national parliaments met this challenge during the first wave in the spring 2020, and we argue that institutional powers of the executive designed to handle crises just like a pandemic, paradoxically, increase challenges to democratic decision-making because the parliament misses opportunities to negotiate institutional adjustments accommodating pressure of government takeover. We evaluate this argument based on a comparative study of parliamentary activity in Italy and Denmark during the first wave of COVID-19 and find that both parliaments came under pressure with regard to law-making and control, but only the Danish parliament was able to install effective mechanisms to regain lost powers. It is too early to conclude on parliamentary consequences of COVID-19, but our study suggests that parliamentary reforms in response to the COVID-19 democratic challenges will mainly manifest in political systems without strong institutions to handle states of emergency.’"

This windfall represents both a historic opportunity for economic revitalization and an unprecedented external constraint for Italy. By linking two established research agendas, the coalition life cycle and the Europeanisation of domestic politics, this study examines the extent to which external constraints arising from EU membership may have affected coalition governance. Using a longitudinal design spanning almost three decades (1996-2023), the study finds that the implementation of the recovery plan is associated both with new trends and the accentuation of existing ones, including the strengthening of the prime minister’s role.’"
