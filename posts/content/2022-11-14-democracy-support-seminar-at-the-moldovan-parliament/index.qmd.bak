I was honoured with the invitation to be part of the panel of academic experts who contributed to the Democracy support seminar held in the Moldavian parliament on 11th November 2022. The seminar was organized by the European Parliament's [Democracy Support and Elections coordination group](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/globaldemocracysupport/en/parliaments/overview). The goal of the seminar was to discuss many aspects of the legislative cycle with a comparative perspective and provide Moldavian MPs with examples of best practices to choose from.
