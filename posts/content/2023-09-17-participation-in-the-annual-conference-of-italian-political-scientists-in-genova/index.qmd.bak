The Annual Conference of Italian Political Scientists, hosted by the University of Genova from the 14th to the 16th of September 2023, proved to be a stimulating gathering of academics and friends. I presented a co-authored paper on the performance of the Meloni Government during its first year. Presented by myself, alongside Marco Improta and Francesco Marangoni, our paper provided a critical analysis of the Italian government led by Giorgia Meloni.
