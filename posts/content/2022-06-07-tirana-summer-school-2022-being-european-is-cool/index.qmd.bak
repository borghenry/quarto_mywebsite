"Being European is cool" brought together students from Albania ([Fakulteti Shkencave Sociale](https://fshs-ut.edu.al/)) and Italy ([University of Firenze, School of political sciences](https://www.sc-politiche.unifi.it/)) for a three-day event of seminars and activities.

The project is organized under the program #TiranaEYC2022 with the support of the National Youth Congress and in collaboration with the Municipality of Tirana.
