On November 7, 2023, Villa Ruspoli in Florence played host to a conference, marking the culmination of extensive research conducted under the theme "A 'Union of Citizens': Convergences and Divergences in the Legal Status of Various Subjects Regulated by EU Law". The conference served as a platform for gathering valuable feedback on the research from a distinguished audience comprising both academics and practicioners. During this conference, I had the privilege of presenting the [EU Talks project](http://www.edfirenze.eu/eventi-notizie/eu-talks-2023-evento-finale-nel-salone-dei-duecento), which has now reached its third edition.
