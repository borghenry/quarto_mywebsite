The SISP (Società Italiana di Scienza Politica) Conference 2022 took place at the Department of Political Sciences Sapienza Università di Roma from 8 to 10 September 2022. I presented a co-authored paper entitled "Who cares for young people? An analysis of parliamentary questions in Italy and France".
