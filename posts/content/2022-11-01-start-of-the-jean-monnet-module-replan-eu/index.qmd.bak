**REPLAN-EU Implementing Resilience and Recovery Plans in Italy and beyond**

[Link to the website](https://www.replaneu.unifi.it/)

The reforms and funds linked to the [Recovery and Resilience Facility](https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/recovery-coronavirus/recovery-and-resilience-facility_en) (RRF) within the [Next Generation EU](https://next-generation-eu.europa.eu/index_en) program represent an extraordinary opportunity for transforming member states' societies and economies. What is more, a successful recovery might contribute to strengthen EU legitimacy, exactly when the integration process is under attack from different fronts.Â 

Yet, EU studies curricula tend to overlook how National Recovery and Resilience Plans (NRRPs) are designed, the extent they are implemented on the ground, as well as how they are evaluated ex-post.

The REPLAN-EU Jean Monnet module aims at filling this gap by developing teaching activities on the political dynamics underlying the implementation of national recovery plans, from the input side - definition of CSR -- to the output side - the domestic political processes which are shaping national reforms.
