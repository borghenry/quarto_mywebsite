On October 19, 2023, the third REPLAN seminar on "Equal Recovery Opportunities: PNRR and Gender Equality" took place at Libreria Campus, located at Via delle Pandette 14, Florence. The event was organised in collaboration with Europedirect Firenze, Ponte Europa, EUI and Unifi CDE and was part of the Caffé Europa seminar series.

This event was a platform for discussing the critical intersection of gender equality and Italy's National Recovery and Resilience Plan (PNRR) and featured the following speakers:

-   Enrico Borghetto (University of Florence)

-   Matilde Ceron (University of Salzburg)

-   Costanza Hermanin (European University)

The discussions revolved around the role of the PNRR in fostering gender equality and the importance of incorporating gender perspectives into the recovery plans. It explored how investments, policies, and actions within the PNRR can be leveraged to create equal opportunities for women and men in various aspects of society.
