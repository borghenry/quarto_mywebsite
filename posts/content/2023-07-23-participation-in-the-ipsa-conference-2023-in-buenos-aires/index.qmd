I just returned from the 2023 IPSA World Congress in Buenos Aires, and I am so glad that I was able to attend. The conference was a great opportunity to meet with other political scientists from around the world, learn about new research, and present my own work.

One of the highlights of the conference for me was being elected to the board of [RC08 - Legislative Specialists](https://www.ipsa.org/page/rc08-legislative-specialists). This is a great honor, and I am looking forward to working with other scholars to promote research on legislatures.
