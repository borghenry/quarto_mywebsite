The **2021 IPSA World Congress of Political Science** took place virtually for the first time in IPSA's 72 years history, from 10 to 15 July 2021. I was involved in the following tasks:

-   Chair in the panel: "Are the Poor Represented in Parliament?" where I also presented my coauthored (with Luca Manucci) paper "Is the populist Robin Hood just a tale? Studying attention for the topic of poor assistance in seven parliaments"

-   Discussant in 2 panels

    -   Comparative Perspectives on Populism

    -   Democracy and the Populist Challenge

-   Speaker in the roundtable "The State of the European Union: Diagnosis and Future Trends" promoted by the section of European Studies
