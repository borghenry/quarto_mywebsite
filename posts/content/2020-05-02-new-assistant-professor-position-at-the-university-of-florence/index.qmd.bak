Since April 2020, I have started a new Assistant Professor position at the [School of Social Sciences "Cesare Alfieri"](https://www.sc-politiche.unifi.it/), University of Florence.\
No words can express my profound gratitude for the friends and colleagues whom I have been collaborating with at the [Faculty of Social and Human Sciences](https://www.fcsh.unl.pt/) in Lisbon for the last 7 years. It has been a priviledge to work first at [CICS.NOVA](https://www.cics.nova.fcsh.unl.pt/) and then at [IPRI](http://www.ipri.pt/index.php/pt/). I learned and grew a lot professionally during these years. I will always consider FCSH and Lisbon my second home and I look forward to starting new joint projects in the future.
