The [conference](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/globaldemocracysupport/en/home/home) celebrated the 10th anniversary of the European Parliament's activities to support democracy around the world. MEPs and high-level guests gathered in Brussels on 29-30 November to reflect on ten years of Parliament's activities to support democracy and discuss key lessons for the future. I participated as speaker in the Working Session I - Comprehensive approach to the institutional reform and capacity development - "Moldova: supporting the European path through dialogue and capacity building - including Triangle for Democracy"
