The [Hambach Democracy Dialogue 2023](https://www.fes.de/en/hambach-democracy-dialogue), held on June 15th and 16th 2023, addressed the pressing challenges faced by European democracies due to a series of overlapping crises: the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the rise of the illiberal right, the COVID-19 pandemic, and energy and cost-of-living issues. The conference focused on the topic of defending Social Democracy in such circumstances. Distinguished speakers and experts from various fields examined these crises from different perspectives and deliberated on how democracies should effectively respond to these developments.

I participated as an expert in the panel discussion titled "How rich private actors disproportionately influence democratic decision making and what can be done about it."
