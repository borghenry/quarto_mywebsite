The final session of EU Talks occurred on the afternoon of May 23rd, within the historical Salone dei Duecento of Palazzo Vecchio. The event was organised by the University of Florence, the researcher-led working group Ponte Europa at EUI, Europe Direct Firenze and the Municipality of Florence.
EU Talks serve as a platform for students from the University of Florence to engage in discussions on the future of Europe. These discussions also involve facilitators selected from researchers at UniFI and the EUI. Throughout the event, UniFI students had the opportunity to present and reflect on the outcomes of their deliberations through three roundtable discussions focusing on mobility, equal opportunities, and cultural heritage. At the conclusion of the deliberation process, the groups were encouraged to propose constructive ideas regarding the three topics within the context of Florence.
This year marked the first close collaboration with the Municipality of Florence for the project. As a result, this third edition of EU Talks adopted a local dimension, urging the groups to consider the European and local contexts while deliberating on the mentioned themes.
