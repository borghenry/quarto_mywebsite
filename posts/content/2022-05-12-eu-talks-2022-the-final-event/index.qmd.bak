The final event of the EU Talks 2022 project took place in the beautiful hall of "Salone dei Cinquecento" in Palazzo Vecchio, Firenze. We had the pleasure to be part of the [Festival of Europe](https://www.festivaldeuropa.eu/) programme and to hold the event on Europe Day.

EU Talks is a joint project of the University of Florence, the European University Institute and Europe Direct Firenze. The recording of the event is available here: <https://youtu.be/8weI9BRAYRE>

The position papers drafted by the students' round-tables are available [here](http://www.edfirenze.eu/eventi-notizie/eu-talks-ci-vediamo-lanno-prossimo).
